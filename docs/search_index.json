Ultimately, I’ll use the biomod2 package but in the learning phase, I am running models without it. 0.1 Set-up If you have not updated R recently (in the last 6 months), go ahead and do that. Also update RStudio is you haven’t done that recently. The code will use the following R packages which you should install. library(biomod2) biomod2 3.4.6 loaded.
