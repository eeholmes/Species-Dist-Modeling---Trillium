# Species-Dist-Modeling---Trillium

A project to learn how to do species distribution modeling (SDM) in R. Ultimately, I'll use the biomod2 package eventually but in the learning phase, I am running models without it.

To explore, start with the Rmd (R Markdown) files labelled 01_, 02_, etc. It is probably easiest to go through the material from the material in online book form [here](https://eeholmes.github.io/Species-Dist-Modeling---Trillium/).


Example of 4 SDMs for Painted Trillium using different variables.
