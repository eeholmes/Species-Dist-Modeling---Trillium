## A possible question


## Basic

* Using the [EpiCollect App](https://five.epicollect.net/), visit random sites, search for the Trillium species and then record presence/absence.

* Use that to test the SDMs produced from non-random iNaturalist data.

## Hubbard Brook

Using 10-20 random 1km x 1km grids in Hubbard Brook, so a survey and count the density of Trillium along with other attributes. If you can visit sites with the weather stations, that would be ideal (but might not be possible).

Or do a transect while walking to research sites.
